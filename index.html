        <h1>History of Web Development</h1>
        <p>
          Web development has evolved significantly since the creation of the
          World Wide Web in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. In the early 1990s,
          websites were simple, text-based pages written in HTML. As the web
          grew, CSS and JavaScript were introduced, allowing for better design
          and interactivity. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of
          dynamic web applications with technologies like PHP, ASP, and
          databases such as MySQL. The emergence of Web 2.0 brought
          user-generated content, social media, and AJAX for seamless updates.
          Modern web development now includes frameworks like React, Angular,
          and Vue.js, along with backend technologies such as Node.js and cloud
          computing. Responsive design, progressive web apps (PWAs), and
          AI-driven applications continue to shape the web, making it more
          interactive and accessible.

        <h2>What is Web Development Proposal</h2>
        <p>
          A web development proposal is a formal document outlining the details
          of a web development project. It is typically created by a web
          developer or agency to present their plan to a client before starting
          work. The proposal serves as a roadmap, defining the project scope,
          objectives, timeline, budget, and technical requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Components of a Web Development Proposal</h3>
